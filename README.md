# autolight
Arduino auto-adjusting lightbulb.

Status: work in progress, not fully functional yet.

## What is it?
A lightbulb that adjusts the room's brightness to a user-defined level and only lights up when human presence exists.
I'll add the board layout someday, open an issue if you're interested.

## Why?
I started this project to explore the world of product design, attempting to create a lightbulb that does it's job with as little human interaction as possible.

## Disclaimer
This is my first arduino project, so take everything with a grain of salt :wink:
